# Rotating-Atmosphere-Sim
Project 1, a basic simulation of an atmosphere above a spinning body.

Required libraries: pygame, sys, random

This came out of a conversation exploring how does an atmosphere behave far above the surface of a planet. Does it rotate with the same angular velocity due to the effect of friction or is there a slowing down as you move further from the surface of the planet?

This is a basic depiction of friction equalizing angular velocities of an atmosphere around a spinning planet.
